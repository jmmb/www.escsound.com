e / s \ c -- electric / sonic \ council -- is an electronic music project from
Minneapolis composer and producer Jim Bjorklun. It aims to bring instrumental
dance music to a personal, potential place.

The story begins around 1995, when Jim became enamored with electronic music
from the U.K. He started collecting used synths, samplers and drum machines, and
began exploring. These experiments developed into jammy patterns, which evolved
into songs.

Jim also felt that each song could be a chapter in a mythical story or tale.
With this in mind, he started sampling from cable TV, sound effects records, and
even his wristwatch. He then added these samples to the songs, until an album
fell into place.

Jim finally recorded and mixed this music with an analog-style approach, and no
PC in sight. The resulting 10 tracks make up the debut album “[Down To Earth](https://escs0und.bandcamp.com/album/down-to-earth){:target="_blank"}”, which was released June 25th, 2021.

And while the sounds all come from electronic sources, the songs are based on
emotions and experience. The focus is on looking within to find counsel and
insight while navigating through life.
